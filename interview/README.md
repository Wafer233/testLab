原网站为 `Golang Roadmap` 付费材料，因为苦于 `bilibili` 只有视频没有文字材料，因此花费39大洋买下文字材料。又因为原网站做的跟狗屎一样，因此自己再手动整理一手，方便自己查阅。

The original website is the paid material of `Golang Roadmap`. Because `bilibili` only has videos but no text materials, I spent 39 dollars to buy the text materials. And because the original website is as bad as shit, I manually organized it for my own reference.
